# Transliteration example using indic-trans in python

## Results

I didn't like it that much though. But it provides good enough results. Better to use something else if you have still time left

// How to set it up

```zsh
    cd indictrans
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    pip install .
```

Then run the example

```zsh
    python main.py
```
